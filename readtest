Write a console app in PHP that satisfy these requirements:

System shows all available items to bid on.
System records a bid from users which the maximum amount that the user want to bid for an item.
System finalizes the winner with the winning price.

For example,
Bid items:
ID             Name           Start Price       Increase Bid Amount 

 1          iPhone 11               200                           10

 2          SS Note 10              150                            5

User A bid for item 1 with price $400;
User B bid for item 1 with price $300;
System select the winner is User A with the price to pay is $310.
In this case, User A can pay up to $400 to win the bid. But he don't need to. He just need to pay more than $300 (max price of user B) to win. So the result is $310 ($10 more as Increase Bid Amount).
 
Directions

While working on this app keep in mind that we want to see how well you can understand the needs of a client, how well you can implement a solution to meet those needs, your ability to comment code, and your object oriented programming skills.
Please don't use persistent storage (e.g. SQL database) or spend much time on the UI (unless you love doing that)
No need for authentication.
 
Good luck and weâ€™re excited to see the results!
